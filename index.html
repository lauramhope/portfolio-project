    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>I'm a 34 year-old female starting my journey into the <strong>software development</strong> world. I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA and have lived there all my life until 2 years ago when I made the big cross-country move to Seattle, WA.</p>

    <h3>Education:</h3>
    <p>I graduated with my <strong>Doctorate in Physical Therapy</strong> in 2021, but quickly realized that my passions belonged elsewhere. After much research, I found <strong>Epicodus</strong> and knew this would be the best path for me to pursue my career in coding.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies/Interests:</h3>
    <p>Currently, my hobbies include rock climbing, weight lifting, reading, and spending as much time as I can outside. I'm very extroverted and love spending quality time with my partner, family, and friends. I love animals and would happily take 5 or more dogs from the humane society if I could!</p>
