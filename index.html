    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a 34 year-old life-long student starting my journey into the <strong>software development</strong> world. I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA and have lived there all my life until 2 years ago when I made the big cross-country move to Seattle, WA.</p>

    <h3>Education/Skills</h3>
    <p>I graduated with my <strong>Doctorate in Physical Therapy</strong> in 2021, but quickly realized that my passions belonged elsewhere. After much research, I found <span class="highlight">Epicodus</span> and knew this would be the best path for me to pursue my career in coding. Below are the skills and certifications I've acquired thus far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Epicodus</strong>: HTML/CSS</li>
      <li><strong>Epicodus</strong>: VS Code</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Therapy</strong>: ASTYM Certification</li>
      <li><strong>Physical Therapy</strong>: Gait-analysis Certification</li>
    </ul>

  <div id="hobbies-interests">
    <h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
    <p>Currently, my hobbies include rock climbing, weight lifting, reading, and spending as much time as I can outside. I'm <em>very</em> extroverted and <em>love</em> spending quality time with my partner, family, and friends. I also <em>love</em> animals and would <u>happily</u> take 5 or more dogs from the humane society if I could!</p>
