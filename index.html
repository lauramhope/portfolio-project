  <h1>Portfolio Spotlight</h1>
  <h2>Laura Hope</h2>
  <h4>34, Seattle, WA</h4>
  <h3>About Me:</h3>
  <p>I'm a 34 year-old female starting my journey into the software developing world. I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA and have lived there all my life until 2 years ago when I made the big cross-country move to Seattle, WA.</p>
  <h3>Education:</h3>
  <p>I graduated with my Doctorate in Physical Therapy in 2021, but quickly realized that my passions belonged elsewhere. After much research, I found Epicodus and knew this would be the best path for me to pursue my career in coding.</p>
  <h3>Hobbies/Interests:</h3>
  <p>Currently, my hobbies include rock climbing, weight lifting, reading, and spending as much time as I can outside. I'm very extroverted and love spending quality time with my partner, family, and friends. I love animals and would happily take 5 or more dogs from the humane society if I could!</p>
